# updates since beta:
* fixed all bugs with lists of courses shopping and taking
* abstracted out javascript and css files to make codebase cleaner
* switched to template inheritance scheme to dramatically reduce amount of code
* improved search function to include partial matches to all fields
* enabled "recently viewed" courses list using local storage
* added "back" button to all pages except for courses viewed when coming from a page generated from the search form, because this causes an error due to jquery mobile's lack of support for re-submitting POST requests.
* improved styling on most pages, added some more icons, and improved amount of information given on each course
* added some finishing touches, such as "no courses to be shown yet" messages if you haven't shopped or taken a course yet, etc.
* profited!
