(371, 8654, 'AFRAMER', '99', 'Senior Thesis Workshop', 'Thesis supervision under the direction of a member of the Department.'),
(372, 56863, 'AFRAMER', '102', 'The Hip Hop Generation and Post-Civil Rights Black Politics', 'The representatives of this new day (sporting baggy clothes and spitting rap lyrics) seem to contrast with the public image of Civil Rights icons like Martin Luther King, Jr. (the clean cut, orator). But despite surface dissimilarities these figures bear an eerie resemblance. Both the emcee and the orator assume that black male leadership is a reliable index for the fate of the black community. This course mixes a diverse set of readings with music and film to interrogate the specific generational tensions that structure popular and intellectual discourses concerning the "hip-hop generation" and the perceived demise of contemporary black politics.'),
(373, 49412, 'AFRAMER', '104y', 'Transnational Feminisms', 'Typically understood as an unbound field, transnational feminisms comes together as a paradigm that calls attention to the intersections of globalizations, race, sexuality, diasporas and nationalisms from a transnational perspective. Mostly from third world and women of color feminists, we will examine this unwieldy designation in relation to methodologies, analytics, contentions and silences. Where and when does the emergence of this term come to be? How does it differ from other feminist and internationalist/globalization perspectives? What role (if any) does religion or spirituality play in the differing theoretical frameworks?'),
(374, 64519, 'AFRAMER', '104z', 'Voodooizations and the Politics of Representation', 'This course will examine the process by which representations of Black spiritualities in film and media have constructed a genre of "voodoo" as well as "voodooizations" of different religious and spiritual beliefs. This class will not be about vodou or vodun the spiritual/religious belief system. Instead, we will address differing politics of representation, we will engage in theories of reception and commodification, cultural studies, performance theory, postcolonial theories, critical feminist and queer media studies.'),
(375, 91872, 'AFRAMER', '104', 'Witchcraft, Rituals and Colonialism', 'This course will explore the coming together of ideas on witchcraft and rituality as discourses and practices of power, gender, race, and sexuality in colonial and imperial moments. We will examine history, literature, films, and social theory dealing with different forms of self-identified and interpellated forms of "witchcraft" such as questions of sorcery, brujeria, shamanism, voodoo/hoodoo, and santeria/palo - all as complex and multivalent sites of productive power. We will look at how discourses and experiences marked and claimed "witchcraft" intersect with ideas and practices of rituals in the everyday lives and perceptions of colonial, postcolonial, national, and transnational subjects in different locations. Students will take into consideration these questions in relation to broader topics such as colonialism/postcolonialism, imperialisms, and transnationalisms, as well as within critiques of modernisms versus traditionalisms. This course will specifically focus on Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, and African diasporic contexts.'),
(376, 22792, 'AFRAMER', '111', 'Spectral Fictions, Savage Phantasms: Race and Gender in Anti-Racist South African and African American Drama, Fiction and Film', 'Why have social orders like Apartheid South Africa and White Supremacy in segregated America that are based on extreme racial, gender and national oppression always generated often violent, hallucinatory fictions of the racial and gender identities of the oppressed? And why have the oppressed in turn often internalized these sorts of fictions and also produced counter-fictions that more or less conform to the same violent, phantasmic logic? In this course, we will explore how these fictions and counter-fictions are reproduced and challenged in some of the most powerful, canonical works of drama, fiction and cinema by South African and African American authors and filmmakers. As the Nigerian author, Chinua Achebe once famously remarked: "where one thing stands, another thing will stand beside it." To this end, we will pay special attention in the course to how, both in form and in content, race and gender always seem, constitutively, to intersect in these fictions and counter-fictions. The course is thus a study in the dark, violent but generative cultural unconscious of modern racialized and gendered identities.'),
(377, 7429, 'AFRAMER', '118', 'The History of African Americans From the Slave Trade to the Great Migration', 'Topics include the rise of slavery; the American Revolution and the problem of freedom; African American social, economic, and cultural life in the antebellum North and South; the Civil War; Reconstruction; African Americans in the Jim Crow South; and the Great Migration. Thematically, we explore the meaning of freedom, the dynamic between black struggle and white resistance, and the ways in which factors like gender and geography complicated any notions of a single black experience.'),
(378, 3426, 'AFRAMER', '128', 'Black Nationalism', 'Critically examines the family of African American social philosophies generally classified under the broad rubric "black nationalism." Topics to be explored include the meaning of black collective self-determination; the relationship between black identity and black solidarity; and the significance of Africa for black nationalist ideals. Authors to be discussed include Martin Delany, Alexander Crummell, Edward Blyden, W.E.B. Du Bois, Marcus Garvey, Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X, Stokely Carmichael, Huey Newton, and some contemporary representatives of the tradition.'),
(379, 16591, 'AFRAMER', '136', 'Black Religion and Economic Thought', 'Since Emancipation African American religious leaders and their congregants have employed religion not only as a means of achieving social and political mobility, but also as a means of securing economic growth and independence in light of the conditions created under American capitalism. These approaches have varied from the pragmatic strategies of Booker T. Washington, the socialist leanings of Rev. George Washington Woodbey, the "poor people''s campaign" of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the increasingly popular prosperity ministries of today''s neo-Pentecostal and Word of Faith communities. Such changes in strategies often coincide with changes in America''s political economy over the past century. This course attempts to interrogate the development of these various strands of economic thought using texts by scholars like Max Weber (The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism), E. Franklin Frazier (The Black Bourgeoisie), and David Harvey (An Introduction to Neoliberalism) as anchoring texts to frame the social, economic and political contexts in which these strategies emerge. Other texts, including autobiographies, ethnographies, and histories offer details of how these religious understandings are framed and practiced.'),
(380, 93434, 'AFRAMER', '139x', 'Power, Struggle, and Abolition in the Atlantic World', 'History is often interpreted as the struggle for power. This course examines how resistance plays a central role in the formation of individual and collective identities among black historical actors in the Atlantic world. The course focuses on the power struggles and efforts by black people to affect social and political change particularly during the eighteenth and nineteenth century. In this class students will cover the significance of major slave rebellions, revolutions, and abolitionist movements within the Atlantic World. Among the questions we consider are: How do powerless people acquire and exercise power? What are the obstacles they must overcome? How do black people living in the Atlantic world perceive, predict, and procure power? How do they define their own empowerment? The course will offer insights on the complexity of the region''s peoples, and will contribute to students'' critical thinking. In papers, students will discuss interpretive questions that focus specifically on the representations, historiographical debates, and the theory of Atlantic world history.'),
(381, 92126, 'AFRAMER', '142', 'Hiphop and Don''t Stop: Spirituality and Religion', 'Hiphop is a global phenomenon that influences social life far beyond the music and entertainment industries. Yet beyond descriptions and critiques of its mass appeal, few have considered hip-hop''s development of standards and evaluations across all artistic areas and culture. Moreover, the consequences of an audience trained in the changing standards of hip-hop and charged with upholding them, has not been thoroughly explored. This course provides a critical examination of hip-hop in the US and its role as a cultural, political and artistic resource for youth. It will explore the artistic, social, cultural, linguistic and political implications of hip-hop. It is taught from the perspective of cultural and linguistic anthropology and media studies. Each year the course will include a special topic with guest lecturers. Topics include: gender and sexuality, spirituality, health, psychology, philosophy, education, politics, art, nationalism, etc.'),
(382, 2929, 'AFRAMER', '147', 'Racial Identity, Politics, and Public Policy', 'This course examines how race and perceived racial difference affect political discourse, mobilization, representation, and political outcomes. We will examine the fate of policies such as affirmative action and welfare reform, and the prospects for multiracial coalition politics. We will also consider the role of elected representatives, the media, and the traditional racial divide in affecting political outcomes of importance to African Americans and to other communities of color.'),
(383, 88142, 'AFRAMER', '160', 'Christianity, Identity, and Civil Society in Africa', 'This course is a historical survey of the centuries-old Christian traditions in Africa. It begins with an outline of the trajectory of Christianity''s origins and presence in Africa from its beginning in ancient Mediterranean lands through the early period of European missionaries to the contemporary period. The course provides the ethnography of the old mission churches, indigenous independent African churches, and contemporary evangelical and Pentecostal Charismatic movements. The course explores the role of Christianity in relation to historical, cultural, social, and material realities of the African continent. It examines a broad range of topical issues related to conversion, missionization, and the development and growth of Christian agencies in Africa in relation to the construction of social, theological, and religious identities, as well as Christianity''s response to cultural pluralism, nationhood, citizenship, and civil society.'),
(384, 51727, 'AFRAMER', '161', 'Religion, Diaspora, and Migration: Seminar', 'This seminar explores critical and interdisciplinary approaches to the place of religion and the emergence of the new immigrant and diaspora communities in the modern world, and the discourses emerging from the practice of diaspora and migration scholarship. Using historical, ethnographic, and textual sources, the course will illuminate the lived religious experiences of immigrant and diaspora communities in the United States and elsewhere. It introduces critical perspectives on forms of interaction between religion and other aspects of social identity - ethnicity, gender, nationality, race, age, and sexuality, as well as transnational and global influences on social and cultural identity. The course also examines the complex networks of economic, cultural, and technological innovations that the "new" diaspora and immigrant communities have developed to make sense of their spiritual and cultural lives in new situations.'),
(385, 66834, 'AFRAMER', '162', 'Indigenous Religious Traditions and Modernity: Seminar', 'This seminar explores historical, theoretical, methodological, and conceptual issues central to the study of indigenous religions of the world. It examines the critique of indigeneity and explores emerging topics about the role that religion plays in indigenous peoples'' lives, communities, and societies. Special topics will explore issues related to land, environment, conversion, health, the state, gender, aggression, violence, justice, and human rights. The seminar examines the interface of indigenous religions and modernity, colonial and postcolonial conditions, and local and global forces that shape the practices of indigenous traditions in various regions of the world.'),
(386, 40604, 'AFRAMER', '172', 'Protest, Rebellion and Power in East African History', 'Examines African responses to the imposition of colonial rule and to the impact of the post-colonial period in the countries of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda. Themes include initial African resistance to colonial rule, organized protests and violent rebellion against colonial institutions, and post-colonial struggles for power in the region. Case studies include popular rebellion in Zanzibar, the Mau Mau Emergency, the regime of Idi Amin, and the Rwandan genocide.'),
(387, 6977, 'AFRAMER', '174', 'The African City', 'This seminar investigates critical issues in Africa''s rich urban centers. Architecture, city planning, spatial framing, popular culture, and new art markets will be examined.'),
(388, 9532, 'AFRAMER', '179', 'Jazz, Freedom, and Culture', 'This course explores the history of jazz improvisation as a musical process, as well as, the cultural, aesthetic, and social debates that shaped the development of the music. On the one hand, jazz fashioned itself as the ultimate modern music with freedom and justice for all, and, on the other, provided an arena in which complex debates about race, cultural ownership, and social disparity repeatedly took place. Understanding of the process of improvisation is paramount, as the freedom of musical expression in jazz is contrasted with the lack of freedom provided by the social and legal contexts in which the music developed.'),

But friendship has not always been seen as a lesser relation of romance. This raises some important questions about the nature of friendship, and this course will examine these and other related topics.'),

Who, and what, are poems for? For poets? Readers? To give vent to the soul? To paint or sculpt with words? Alter consciousness? Raise cultural tone? Students will read, write about and also recite American poems.'),

This course tries to find the center of the Modernist movement (1872-1927) by studying the literature, music, and painting of the period, to see whether some congruence of effort in all these media can be found. By looking at the range of artistic production in a few key years, we come to know this age of aesthetic extremism, perhaps unparalleled in Western history.'),

Nowhere are diverse music traditions more prominently represented in public performance and maintained in private practice than in North America, where centuries of immigration and an increasingly multiethnic population have given rise to a complex musical environment. "Soundscapes" explores a cross-section of the different musical styles that coexist and interact in today''s society, examining their relationship to their historical homelands and to their present-day settings.'),

What gives them this power? How do writers become adjectives like Babelian, Bellovian, or Kafkaesque? This course moves through the twentieth century through the literature of a multilingual people, with works in Hebrew, Yiddish, German, Russian, Italian, and English. We see how variously Jewish writers interpret modern history and their own situation within it.'),

It examines how the modern lure of free will and emancipated subjectivity drove Chinese to redefine terms of affect, such as love, feeling, desire, passion, sexuality, loyalty, dedication, revolution and sacrifice. It also looks into how the moral, legal and political consequences of affect were evoked in such a way as to traverse or fortify consensual boundaries and their manifestations.'),

How can words with such different spellings as "eight" and "ate" be pronounced alike? Where do dialects come from? Who decides whether a split infinitive is correct or not? What did Shakespeare''s English sound like? Why does English lack grammatical gender? Why is "long i" really a diphthong? What happened to "thou"? Is American English destined to grow more distinct? What does the future of English look like? This course addresses such questions as it surveys the changes across the centuries. Lectures will be supplemented by exercises from the course website. Besides addressing everyone''s curiosity about the features of the language, this course can help students understand the literature of earlier periods and can give greater confidence in reading and writing.

We address the first of these questions via the second, presenting an interdisciplinary approach to the study of human languages. We investigate language as the product of a natural algorithm, that is, a computational facility which grows spontaneously in our species and enables us to expose our thoughts and feelings. Our investigation uses formal models from logic, linguistics, and computer science. These models will also shed light on human nature and basic philosophical issues concerning language.');

We analyze which of these tools are best for communicating what kinds of data, and why. Ideas about causality, approximation, statistical significance, credibility, and dimensionality will be addressed by analyzing real data and their display. The data will be drawn from medical, astronomical, social-science, aerospace, financial, and geographic examples. Approximately one-third of the course will focus on web, interactive, and live presentations of data. Much of the course''s philosophy is based on the work of Edward Tufte.'),

How was this possible? The course will trace the theme of slavery through the arguments of political theorists from the ancient world to the present and will study the way in which the rejection of slavery became intellectually possible. These theoretical arguments will be considered in the context of the changing history of slavery as an institution.'),

What is the relative value of justice, citizenship, loyalty, friendship, personal profit, and pleasure? Is the good life the same for everyone? This course is devoted to investigating how classical South Asian intellectuals approached such questions and to thinking critically about their responses. As we will see, far from being mere artifacts from someone else''s historical past, classical South Asian texts provide powerful frameworks for thinking about our own lives and the ways in which we reason about them.'),

The background concern is our struggle, in philosophy, religion, and art, with nihilism: the fear that our lives and the world itself may be meaningless. The foreground theme is the contrast between two answers to the question about how to live one''s life: stay out of trouble and look for trouble. How speculative thought has dealt with the limits of insight into what matters most. Exemplary writings from several traditions: modern European, ancient Greek, Chinese, South Asian.'),
